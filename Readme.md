# SCSS & Build Tools - Lunch and Learn

This is our first SGC Web Team Lunch and Learn (at least as far as I know), and it's about the joys of SCSS and build tools!!! Code will be uploaded and freely accessible, along with my notes in Markdown format. Enjoy!

## Quick Start Instructions

After you pull down this repo, you can run the following commands in the root folder to get started:

```
npm install
```

This will grab all of your node modules and store them in the "node_modules" folder, which we have ignored for versioning. Then to compile your assets, you can run the following command:

```
npm run watch
```

That will run the watch command that continue to watch for saved files, and update the dist folder accordingly.
